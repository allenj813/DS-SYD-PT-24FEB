On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n","\n","> One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
